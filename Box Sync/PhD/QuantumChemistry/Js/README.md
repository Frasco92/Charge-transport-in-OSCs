# Calculate J

Scripts and codes for calculating the transfer integral (electronic coupling) J between two molecules.

- The folder OriginalProjectiveMethod contains the codes for calculation with the projective method using gaussian, c++ and octave

- The folder ProjectiveMethod has combined the above into one python script

- The folder OriginalCounterpoiseMethod contains the original python code for calculating with the counterpoise method

- The folder CounterpoiseMethod contains the updated (Python) codes for calculating J with the counterpoise method

The script launch_coms.sh runs a Gaussian com file on cx1 at Imperial College. The file HEADER_opt can be appended to a molecule xyz file for an optimisation with Gaussian.
